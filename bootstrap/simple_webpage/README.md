## Simple Webpage

# Create a simple webpage using Bootstrap:

- Go to the Bootstrap website and download the latest version of Bootstrap.
- Extract the downloaded files to a folder on your computer.
Create a new HTML file in a text editor or code editor of your choice (e.g., index.html).
- Inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file, include the Bootstrap CSS file:
    `<link href="path/to/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">`
- Inside the `<body>` section of your HTML file, create the basic structure of your webpage using Bootstrap classes. For example:
    `<div class="container"> <h1>Welcome to My Bootstrap Page</h1> <p>This is a simple webpage created using Bootstrap.</p> </div>`
- If you want to use Bootstrap's JavaScript components (e.g., modals, carousels), include the Bootstrap JavaScript file at the end of the <body> section:
    `<script src="path/to/bootstrap.min.js"></script>`
- Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser to preview your webpage.
- Make sure the layout and styles are applied correctly using Bootstrap.
- Customise your webpage by adding more content and using other Bootstrap components (e.g., buttons, forms, navbar) as needed.
- Experiment with different Bootstrap classes and components to enhance the appearance and functionality of your webpage.
