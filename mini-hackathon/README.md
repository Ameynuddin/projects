### Hackathon: "Full-Stack Web Development Challenge"
This hackathon is designed to encourage participants to apply their knowledge across the full stack of web development technologies covered during the bootcamp. 

## OBJECTIVE
Participants will build a web application that incorporates various technologies covered in the bootcamp, showcasing their proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React OR Vue, Bootstrap, Git, and GitHub.

## Hackathon Tasks
Task 1: Design and HTML 
Challenge: Design a landing page for a fictional web application.
Requirements:
Use HTML to structure the page.
Include navigation, header, main content, and a footer.
Implement semantic HTML elements.

Task 2: Styling with CSS 
Challenge: Apply styles to the landing page.
Requirements:
Use CSS for layout and styling.
Demonstrate knowledge of CSS Flexbox or Grid.
Make the page responsive for various screen sizes.

Task 3: Adding Interactivity with JavaScript 
Challenge: Enhance the landing page with interactive features.
Requirements:
Use JavaScript to create dynamic elements.
Implement event listeners for user interactions.
Provide feedback through animations or transitions.

Task 4: Integrating React or Vue (choose one framework only for this hackathon)
Challenge: Convert the landing page into a single-page application (SPA).
Requirements:
If using React: Set up a React project and convert the landing page.
If using Vue: Set up a Vue project and convert the landing page.
Demonstrate component-based architecture.

Task 5: State Management and API Integration 
Challenge: Fetch and display dynamic data using state management.
Requirements:
If using React: Integrate state management with React (e.g., Redux).
If using Vue: Integrate state management with VueX.
Fetch data from a mock API or use a real API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).

Task 6: Bonus (Optional)
Challenge: Implement additional features or enhancements.
Suggestions:
Add form validation.
Include transitions and animations.
Integrate Bootstrap for styling.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
