### Task

```
Hello World Vue Component:
1.Create a Vue component that simply displays "Hello, Vue!" on the webpage.

Two-Way Binding:
2.Create an input field and display its value below it. Use two-way binding (v-model) to ensure that changes in the input field are reflected in the displayed value in real-time.
Conditional Rendering:

3.Implement a button that toggles the visibility of a message. When the button is clicked, display a message if it's hidden, and hide it if it's currently visible.
List Rendering:

4.Create an array of items (e.g., strings or objects) in your component's data. Use v-for to render each item in the array as a list item (<li>) in an unordered list (<ul>).
Event Handling:

5.Create a button that increments a counter each time it's clicked. Display the current count on the webpage.
Computed Properties:

6.Create two input fields for length and width. Display the calculated area (length * width) below the inputs. Use a computed property to calculate the area.
Passing Data to Child Component:

7.Create a parent component with a data property. Pass this data property as a prop to a child component and display it there.
Emitted Events (Child to Parent Communication):

8.In the child component from the previous task, add a button that emits an event when clicked. Handle this event in the parent component and display an alert message.
